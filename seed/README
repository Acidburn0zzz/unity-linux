This is the buildsystem for the Unity Linux distribution.

We are still heavily based on OpenWrt (thank you) but as 
time goes by this work will be modified more and more for
our own purpose.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and chroot.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your chroot.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

To build your own chroot you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.


Kind Regards,
